# Module_Eleven_UFOs

## Project Overview
Update the UFO webpage and dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources
 - Data Source: ![UFO Data](https://github.com/LLeyva-bot/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)
 - Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, BootStrap

## Results
####  Link to UFO Sightings Webpage: https://lleyva-bot.github.io/UFOs

## Webpage Search Criteria

This is the initial page. The user can refresh the page by clicking on "UFO Sightings" on the top left.

#### Filtering
The user enters the desired date, city, country, or shape.  As soon as an acceptable value is entered within any field, the table filters and adjusts. All fields can be entered simultaneously.

Here is an example of filtering by date:

## Summary
A drawback of this design is the user's inability to know what filter values are acceptable.  In order to determine acceptable filter values, the user must first review the entire table on the initial page. The design could be improved by adding a drop-down box containing all acceptable values for each field.  Also, it would help to add a clear filter button so the user could reset any field rather than refreshing the entire page.
